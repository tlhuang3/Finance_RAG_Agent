      "[Document(page_content=\"The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effects of two or more risks occurring *simultaneously.* Risk Factors **Summary** The following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Economic and Strategic **Risks**\\n- Intel Corporation's dominance of the microprocessor market and its aggressive business practices may limit our ability to compete effectively on a level playing field.  \\n- The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns. - The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. There may be fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries.  \\n- The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us.  \\n- The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive.  \\n- Economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. - Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns. - If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses.  \\n- Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect us.  \\nOperational and Technology **Risks**\\n- We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.  \\n- Essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes may not be available to us. - We may fail to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products.  \\n- The success of our business depends on our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting significant industry transitions.  \\n- Our revenue from our semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.  \\n- Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us.  \\n- IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt operations and compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  \\n- Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\\n27  \\n- Our ability to design and introduce new products includes the use of third-party intellectual property.  \\n- We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.  \\n- If we lose Microsoft Corporation's support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected.  \\n- Our reliance on third-party distributors and add-in-board (AIB) partners subjects us to certain risks.  \\n- Our business depends on the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems. - Our products may not be compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware. - Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.  \\n- We may fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand.  \\n- We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions.  \\n- We may be unable to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market. - Climate change may have a long-term impact on our business.  \\nLegal and Regulatory **Risks**\\n- Government actions and regulations may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers.  \\n- If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  \\n- Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, including as a result of tax regulation changes. - We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation. - We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals regulations, as well as a variety of other laws or regulations..  \\n- Evolving expectations from governments, investors, customers and other stakeholders regarding corporate responsibility matters could result in additional costs, harm to our reputation and a loss of customers.  \\n- Issues related to the responsible use of AI may result in reputational, competitive and financial harm and liability.  \\n- The agreements governing our notes, our guarantees of Xilinx's notes, and our Revolving Credit Agreement impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.  \\nMerger, Acquisition and Integration **Risks**\\n- Acquisitions, joint ventures, and/or investments, and the failure to integrate acquired businesses may fail to materialize their anticipated benefits and disrupt our business.  \\n- Any impairment of our tangible, definite-lived intangible or indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, may adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.  \\nGeneral **Risks**\\n- Our worldwide operations are subject to political, legal and economic risks and natural disasters.  \\n- We may incur future impairments of our technology license purchases.  \\n- Our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business.  \\n- Our stock price is subject to volatility.  \\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\\n28 of\", metadata={'Header 1': 'Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of this Quarterly Report. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following: RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING **BUSINESSES**\\n- We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the *timing* of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively *affected.*\\n- Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically *integrating*\\n(i.e., developing their own integrated circuit *products).*\\n- A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security *tensions.*\\nRISKS RELATED TO NEW **INITIATIVES**\\n- Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product *areas,*\\nand industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future *results* of operations that meet our *expectations.*\\n- We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder *value.*\\nRISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND **MANUFACTURING**\\n- We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.  \\n- There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a *higher* portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to *climate* change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing *issues.*\\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL **INFORMATION**\\n- Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential *information.*\\nRISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL **MANAGEMENT**\\n- We may not be able to attract or retain qualified *employees.*\\nRISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING **BUSINESS**\\n- The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.  \\n- Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or *actions* by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our *business.*\\n- Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or *otherwise,*\\ncould adversely impact our business and results of *operations.*\\n4', metadata={'Header 1': 'Qualcomm Incorporated', 'Header 2': 'Risk Factors Summary:', 'filing_type': '10-Q1', 'ticker': 'QCOM', 'year': '2024'}), Document(page_content='We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. The mobile industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have increased and may continue to increase their device share in China and in certain regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also \"Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items - Concentrations.\"\\nIn addition, a number of our largest customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors\\' integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled \"Our business, particularly our *semiconductor* business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated *circuit* products).\"\\nFurther, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled \"A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security *tensions*.\"\\nIn addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers\\' feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.  \\nThe loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors\\' integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand (or a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices), elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.  \\nFurther, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers\\' new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate.  \\nApple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.  \\nThe mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.  \\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.  \\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees\\' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.', metadata={'Header 1': 'Qualcomm Incorporated', 'Header 2': 'Risks Related To Our Operating Businesses We Derive A Significant Portion Of Our Revenues From A Small Number Of Customers And Licensees, And Particularly From Their Sale Of Premium Tier Handset Devices.

And then they quickly find that they want to run AI on-prem because they want to control their data. They want to secure their data. It's their IP and they want to run domain specific and process specific models to get the outcomes they're looking for. Hopefully that gave you a rich context of what we're seeing across the customer base, the opportunity for us going forward. And this is at node scale, rack scale, and data center scale. Simon was that an AI specific question or broadly across the business? created outside of the data center going forward than inside the data center today. That's going to happen at the edge of the network. A smart factory, an oil derrick or platform, a deep up mine, all variations of this. We believe AI will ultimately get deployed next to where the data is created driven by latency. And we think about this, the opportunity is to get the training and fine tuning, which is well underway now. But I mentioned earlier this notion about AI in production, inferencing, running the actual tool in production to get the outcomes that businesses want. We believe that's the untapped large opportunity, get my words in the right order, going forward for us. So this notion of enterprise, our enterprise customer base growing, we've sold to education customers, manufacturing customers, governments. We've sold to financial services, business, engineering and consumer services companies. They're seeing vast deployments, proving out the technology. And some cases are using the tooling of the Sure, I'll see if I can address the question. I mean, the first thing you probably noticed in our web deck is we increased our view of the opportunity in the marketplace to $152 billion, 20% CAGR going forward to 2027. And quite frankly, that's probably a lagging indicator. It's still catching up. We think demand continues to be ahead of that. Primarily driven is the overall desire, demand for the computational components to do AI exceeds the supply picture. And quite frankly, it's refreshing to see. We have a high growth category here. That growth is happening certainly in the public cloud, but increasingly more so in enterprises, which is what certainly given our reach in the vast capabilities that we have in business to help customers adopt AI into their business flows, I think it's a big opportunity for us. It's where the data is. 83% of all data is on-prem. We think AI moves to the data. More data will be created outside of the data center going forward than inside the data center today.

      "Google's strategy for artificial intelligence, as discussed by Jeff Clarke during the earnings call, involves a significant emphasis on deploying AI at the edge of networks—where data is created—and within enterprise environments, beyond just cloud implementations. Key points include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Local Deployment of AI**: Google recognizes the desire of businesses to control and secure their data by running AI on-premises. This includes domain-specific and process-specific models tailored to unique business needs, facilitating direct outcomes without data leaving their controlled environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Growing Enterprise Customer Base**: The proliferation of AI use among various sectors such as manufacturing, financial services, and government highlights its adoption across different industries. Google's AI technology is being integrated into business workflows of a diverse customer base.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Emphasis on Edge Computing**: With more data being generated outside than inside traditional data centers, Google sees edge computing as a critical area of growth for AI. The low latency and real-time data processing at the edge of networks, such as in smart factories or remote locations, are seen as significant opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Focus on Training and Inference at Scale**: The aim is to facilitate the large-scale adoption of AI whereby companies can utilize it not just for experimentation but for actual production and inferencing—utilizing AI tools in real-time operations to achieve tangible business outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Google is strategically positioned to enhance AI capabilities both in cloud environments and at the edge, leveraging its extensive reach and technological resources to integrate AI into various business flows, thereby creating both growth and innovation opportunities.\n",

We introduced NVIDIA DGX Cloud and AI Foundations to help businesses create and operate custom large language models and generative AI models. As AV algorithms move to video transformers, and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. We estimate that in fiscal year 2024, approximately 40% of Data Center revenue was for AI inference. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, large cloud providers represented more than half of our Data Center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external customers.

      "Critical Accounting **Estimates**\n",
      "Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, cost of revenue, expenses and related disclosure of contingencies. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, revenue recognition, and income taxes. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of significant accounting policies.  \n",
      "Inventories We charge cost of sales for inventory provisions to write-down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory, and for excess product purchase commitments. Most of our inventory provisions relate to excess quantities of products or components, based on our inventory levels and future product purchase commitments compared to assumptions about future demand and market conditions, which requires management judgment.  \n",
      "Situations that may result in excess or obsolete inventory or excess product purchase commitments include changes in business and economic conditions, changes in market conditions, sudden and significant decreases in demand for our products, inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, new product introductions resulting in less demand for existing products or inconsistent spikes in demand, failure to estimate customer demand properly, ordering in advance of historical lead-times, government regulations and the impact of changes in future demand, or increase in demand for competitive products, including competitive actions. Cancellation or deferral of customer purchase orders could result in our holding excess inventory.  \n",
      "The net effect on our gross margin from inventory provisions and sales of items previously written down was an unfavorable impact of 2.7% in fiscal year 2024 and 7.5% in fiscal year 2023. Our inventory and capacity purchase commitments are based on forecasts of future customer demand. We account for our third-party manufacturers' lead times and constraints. Our manufacturing lead times can be and have been long, and in some cases, extended beyond twelve months for some products. We may place non-cancellable inventory orders for certain product components in advance of our historical lead times, pay premiums and provide deposits to secure future supply and capacity. We also adjust to other market factors, such as product offerings and pricing actions by our competitors, new product transitions, and macroeconomic conditions - all of which may impact demand for our products. Refer to the Gross Profit and Gross Margin discussion below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion. Income **Taxes**\n",
      "We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Our calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential U.S. and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly. As of the end of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we had a valuation allowance of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively, related to capital loss carryforwards, and certain state and other deferred tax assets that management determined are not likely to be realized due, in part, to jurisdictional projections of future taxable income, including capital gains. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more-likely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as income tax benefits during the period. We recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.  \n",
      "37 of Revenue Recognition Revenue **Allowances**\n",
      "For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to reflect our estimated exposure for product returns. Return rights for certain stocking distributors for specific products are contractually limited based on a percentage of prior quarter shipments. For shipments to other customers, we do not allow returns, although we may approve returns for credit or refund based on applicable facts and circumstances.  \n",
      "We account for customer programs, which involve rebates and marketing development funds, as a reduction in revenue and accrue for such programs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. Certain customer programs include distributor price incentives or other channel programs for specific products and customer classes which require judgement as to whether the applicable incentives will be attained. Estimates for customer program accruals include a combination of historical attainment and claim rates and may be adjusted based on relevant internal and external factors. License and Development **Arrangements** Revenue from License and Development Arrangements is recognized over the period in which the development services are performed. Each fiscal reporting period, we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. Estimated total cost for each project includes a forecast of internal engineer personnel time expected to be incurred and other third-party costs as applicable. Contracts with Multiple Performance **Obligations** Our contracts may contain more than one performance obligation. Judgement is required in determining whether each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Except for License and Development Arrangements, NVIDIA products and services function on a standalone basis and do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency. Therefore, multiple performance obligations contained within a customer contract are considered distinct and are not combined for revenue recognition purposes.  \n",
      "We allocate the total transaction price to each distinct performance obligation in a multiple performance obligations arrangement on a relative standalone selling price basis. In certain cases, we can establish standalone selling price based on directly observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. If standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, we determine standalone selling price based on market data and other observable inputs. Change in Accounting **Estimate**\n",
      "In February 2023, we assessed the useful lives of our property, plant, and equipment. Based on advances in technology and usage rate, we increased the estimated useful life of a majority of the server, storage, and network equipment from three years to a range of four to five years, and assembly and test equipment from five years to seven years. The estimated effect of this change for fiscal year 2024 was a benefit of $33 million and $102 million for cost of revenue and operating expenses, respectively, which resulted in an increase in operating income of $135 million and net income of $114 million after tax, or $0.05 per both basic and diluted share.  \n",

      "Foreign Exchange Rate **Risk** We consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal as our sales are in United States dollars and foreign currency forward contracts are used to offset movements of foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expenses. The impact of foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in determining net income was not significant for fiscal years 2024 and 2023. Sales and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, and, therefore, are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations. Increases in the value of the United States' dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States' dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their manufacturing costs. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been $116 million and $112 million lower, respectively. Change in value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be expected to offset a corresponding change in hedged forecasted foreign currency expenses when recognized. If an adverse 10% foreign exchange rate change was applied to our balance sheet hedging contracts, it would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before taxes of $60 million and $36 million as of January 28, 2024 and January 29, 2023, respectively. These changes in fair values would be offset in other income (expense), net by corresponding change in fair values of the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, assuming the hedge contracts fully cover the foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities balances.  \n",

      "Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.  \n",

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018.
